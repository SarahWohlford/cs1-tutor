      solution:
        "Direction one: if there is a polynomial verifier $V(x,c)$, a nondeterministic machine can guess certificate $c$ and run $V$, accepting all YES instances in polynomial time. Direction two: if there is a nondeterministic polynomial-time machine, the sequence of choices on an accepting branch can serve as a certificate; a verifier replays that branch and checks it is legal and reaches an accept state, also in polynomial time. So the definitions are equivalent.",

Total time is the sum (or composition) of two polynomials, still polynomial, and correctness follows from the reduction equivalence, so $A\\in P$.",

      solution:
        "You can immediately conclude that $Z$ is NP-complete. This means $Z$ is at least as hard as any problem in NP, while also having polynomial verification; if a polynomial-time algorithm for $Z$ were found later, it would imply $P=NP$.",

        "The conclusion must be \"NP-complete,\" and the explanation must combine the meaning of NP-hard and in-NP with the impact on $P$ vs $NP$.",
