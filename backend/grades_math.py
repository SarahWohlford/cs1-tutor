"""
Deterministic grade math for the Course Grade Tracker (phase 1).

PURE + dependency-free (stdlib only) on purpose: this is the one place grades are
computed, so it can be exhaustively unit-tested and the number it returns is
guaranteed to match a hand calculation. The Learning-Mode agent and the /grades
UI both READ this module's output; neither recomputes. Never let the LLM do the
arithmetic.

Why this exists (the moat)
--------------------------
Real rubrics use CONDITIONAL / rank-based weights that a fixed-weight calculator
(RogerHub, spreadsheets) cannot express. Example that motivated this feature:

    A course with NO final, 4 exams in an "Exams" category worth 25 points, where
    the LOWEST-scoring exam counts 4 points and the other three count 7 each
    (7*3 + 4 = 25).

So the upcoming exam's *effective weight is conditional*: 4 points if it lands as
the lowest, otherwise 7 (and it bumps a prior exam into the 4-point slot). The
"what do I need for an A?" answer is therefore PIECEWISE - the unknown item's
weight can change with its own value. `goal_seek` solves this exactly.

Model
-----
- A Category contributes `weight` points to a 100-point course total.
- A Category's `rule` says how that weight is split across item-slots:
    Uniform(n_slots)            -> every slot equal
    DropLowest(n_slots, k)      -> k lowest-scoring slots drop to 0, rest equal
    RankWeights(slot_weights)   -> explicit per-slot points, assigned to items by
                                   score rank (best score gets the largest weight)
  DropLowest is just RankWeights with trailing zeros; Uniform is RankWeights with
  equal weights. They are kept as distinct, explicit rules for readability.
- Items carry score/max_score; only the *fraction* (score/max) matters for weighting.
