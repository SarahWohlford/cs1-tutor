"""Standing + goal-seek ladder, computed server-side from a rich wire course.

Pure glue between grades_serde (wire -> compute) and grades_math (compute). No HTTP, no
IO, no persistence -> fully unit-testable. The API route is a thin auth + error-mapping
wrapper around `standing_and_ladder`.

Why a batched ladder (eng-review D7 / outside voice #2): the Grades UI recomputes the WHOLE
letter ladder ("what do I need for an A / A- / B+ …") live on every keystroke. A per-letter
endpoint would be N round-trips per edit. So one call returns standing + every letter's
needed-score for ONE unknown item.

Status names are translated to the frontend's vocabulary here (presentation, not math, so it
stays out of grades_math):
    grades_math   ->  wire
    ok            ->  ok          (needed = score on the item's own max scale)
    already_met   ->  locked      (needed = 0; you already have this letter locked in)
    infeasible    ->  unreachable (needed = None; even 100% can't reach it)
