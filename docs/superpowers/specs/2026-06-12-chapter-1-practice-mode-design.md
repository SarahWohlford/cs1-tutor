## Eng-review revisions — LOCKED 2026-06-12 (supersede conflicting text below)

These came out of `/plan-eng-review` plus an outside-voice challenge. Where the body conflicts, **these win.**

1. **Chapter 4 "Proofs", NOT Chapter 1.** Ch.1 (1.1–1.5) is a motivational survey with no real proofs ("a first taste of what a proof is"; 1.6 note: "practice, not new theory"). The proof formats (③ order, ④ flaw, ⑥ free-response) need real proof content → v1 authors **Chapter 4** (Direct / Contraposition / Contradiction / Sets / 4.6 Problems). Every "Chapter 1 / 1.6" reference below means Chapter 4 / 4.6.
2. **Trigger is client-side.** Capture `activeSectionTitle` synchronously from `detail.sectionTitle` in `handleOutlineSectionPreview`; mount `PracticePanel` off **that**, not the server-set `dataMatchedTopic` (needs a round-trip + is a fuzzy label). So warm-up + auto-graded practice are truly **offline**; only the challenge calls `/api/chat`. (The "no backend dependency" claim only holds with this fix.)
3. **Strict trigger** `/^\d+\.\d+\s+Problems$/` — excludes "23.1 Decision Problems", "27 … Problems", "11.5 Problem Solving with Graphs", "12.3 Whirlwind Tour …". Tested.
4. **AI-grading go/no-go eval is the FIRST task** (5 Ch.4 proof attempts: correct / subtly-wrong / hand-wavy / off-topic / blank through the real envelope). If it can't separate correct from plausible-wrong, "Mastered" can't be AI-gated in v1 — surface before building the spine.
5. **`challengeChat.ts` rides `/api/chat`** with a defensive prompt envelope (delimited "ignore textbook matching, you are a rung-N practice tutor") and **ignores `matched_topic`/`reference_*`** in the response. No `system` param exists, so rung rules ride the user message. Self-contained (TODO: unify the 4 `/api/chat` callers later — needs Jin's sites).
6. **Leak guard = prompt hygiene, NOT integrity.** Answer keys live in the client bundle (`focsPracticeSets.ts`), so "withhold below L4" only stops the model over-helping. **DROP** "reveal ≠ Mastered" + its masteryEngine state. **KEEP** "after reveal → twin problem" as pure pedagogy. Real integrity = phase 2 (server).
7. **Proof-order grading = dependency-DAG / topological-sort** (each step declares prerequisites; any valid topo order is correct), NOT exact-sequence. The topo validator is a ~20-line pure function, 100% unit-tested incl. the multi-valid-order case.
8. **Split reuse:** separate `PRACTICE_SPLIT_STORAGE_KEY` (~65/35 practice/textbook), practice-split vs note-split mutually exclusive, auto-open on Problems sections.
9. **Persistence:** versioned key `practice.v1.focs.4`, guarded parse → empty fallback, keyed only to `focs`. **vitest:** first commit = harness + 1 green CI test, before any logic depends on it (it's a new dep touching package.json/CI). **Offline:** warm-up + auto-graded practice fully local; only the challenge degrades (sign-in / connection needed).
10. **Build order (B):** spine (panel + masteryEngine + hint ladder + proof-order) first → spot-flaw + fill-blank fast-follow; all 6 ship on this branch.

## Design-review revisions — LOCKED 2026-06-12

From `/plan-design-review` (focused on states / a11y / responsive; info-arch, AI-slop, and the editorial design system were already locked).

**D-1. Auto-graded feedback = immediate inline, no penalty, explain-on-wrong.** On submit: correct → teal check + advance; wrong → gentle "not quite" + a **one-line `why`** + retry, never a score penalty. Applies to MCQ / proof-order / spot-flaw / fill-blank. → adds a `why: string` field per auto-graded item in `focsPracticeSets.ts`.

**D-2. Interaction states table:**

| Surface | Loading | Empty / first-run | Error | Success |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Auto-graded formats | none (local, instant) | — | n/a (no network) | inline check + advance |
| Challenge hint | reuse `learning-reply-status-spinner` while `/api/chat` is in flight | "Type what you've tried to begin" | inline "couldn't reach the tutor — retry" (attempt preserved) | rung reply renders |
| Practice panel | — | warm intro card: "Practice Chapter 4 — 3 stages to mastery" + primary **Start warm-up** | — | — |
| Mastery | — | tier = Not started | — | hitting **Mastered** → editorial celebration (Caveat note + ring fills), not a modal |

**D-3. Accessibility:** proof-order = drag **plus** up/down move buttons (keyboard-operable, `aria` position announced); spot-flaw lines = real focusable `button`s (Tab/Enter, `aria-pressed`); flashcard flips on Enter/Space; **44px** min touch targets; mastery climb announced via `aria-live`. No interaction is drag-only or hover-only.

**D-4. Responsive:** desktop/tablet = the ~65/35 split; **mobile (<~640px) = practice full-width, textbook becomes a "view textbook" toggle/sheet** (not a stacked split). Drag/move/select targets stay ≥44px on touch.

## 1. Problem & motivation

AI Tutor today reads like *a chatbot you can read a book with*. We want it to feel like *a learning tool* — somewhere a student actively practices and demonstrably masters a chapter, not just reads.

Every FOCS chapter ends with a **"X.Y Problems"** section (`1.6 Problems`, `2.5 Problems`, … `18.6 Problems`). When a student opens a Problems section, the left notes pane should **transform into a practice/quiz experience** for mastering that chapter, with real help when they get stuck — the opposite of Chegg's "paste problem → get answer."

## 2. Goal & success criteria

A student opening **Chapter 1's Problems** section can:

1. Warm up on the chapter's key concepts,
2. Practice auto-graded questions (including proof-shaped ones),
3. Attempt a real proof problem and get **escalating AI help that never just hands over the answer**, and
4. Watch a **chapter mastery** indicator climb Familiar → Proficient → Mastered.

**Success =** the full vertical slice works end-to-end for Chapter 1 on the live frontend, with no backend dependency, and the deterministic logic (mastery, grading, rung rules) is unit-tested and matches hand calculation.

## 3. Scope

### v1 (this slice)
- **One chapter, end-to-end**: Chapter 1 of FOCS, hand-authored mock content.
- All **6 question formats** (below).
- **3-stage flow** (warm-up → practice → challenge), sequentially unlocked, with a "skip to challenge" escape hatch and a "view study note" affordance.
- **Chapter mastery** (upward-only) + a **mastery ring** on the chapter node in the Learning Progress tree.
- **Real AI hint ladder** via the existing `/api/chat` (frontend-orchestrated).
- **localStorage** persistence (anonymous OK).
- Editorial ivory + teal styling, consistent with the Report Card / Chat system.
- vitest coverage of the pure logic.

### Out of scope → phase 2 (explicitly deferred)
- Real textbook problem extraction (`extract_pdf_text_safe`).
- Backend hardening: server-side rung state, hidden answer key, separate anti-farming moderation classifier.
- LLM auto question-generation + QC stack.
- SymPy / code-execution grading.
- Demotion + cross-session spaced-repetition review.
- Sign-in-keyed server storage / cross-device sync.
- Other chapters (2–18) and uploaded textbooks.
- Extra gamification (streaks, XP, leaderboards).

> The data shape is general — extending to more chapters/problems is **adding content, not changing architecture**. The pure-logic modules are the spec for the phase-2 backend.

## 4. The experience & layout

**Trigger:** when the active section title is a problem set — `isProblemsSection(title)` = title ends with `"Problems"`, **excluding** the two decoys `11.5 Problem Solving with Graphs` and `12.3 Whirlwind Tour of Graph Problems`.

**Layout:** the left notes pane renders `<PracticePanel>` instead of `<SectionNotePanel>`. The right textbook-page pane is unchanged (reference). Practice panel, top to bottom:

1. **Mastery header** — chapter mastery bar (Familiar ▸ Proficient ▸ Mastered) + current tier.
2. **Stage stepper** — ① Warm-up · ② Practice · ③ Challenge, with lock/unlock state.
3. **Current stage body** — the active question.

**Affordances:**
- **View study note** — a toggle/link to bring back the section's existing study note (objectives/vocab/formulas) without leaving practice.
- **Skip to challenge** — strong students can jump straight to stage ③, bypassing sequential unlock.

**Stage gating:** stages unlock in order (mastery-gated, à la Khan/Duolingo) but completed stages are re-enterable. The "skip to challenge" link is the deliberate override.

## 5. Question formats (all 6 in v1)

| # | Format | Stage | Grading |
|---|--------|-------|---------|
| ① | **Flashcard** (term ⇄ definition) | Warm-up | self-rated (knew / didn't) |
| ② | **MCQ** (e.g. "which is the contrapositive of P→Q?") | Practice | deterministic (exact) |
| ③ | **Proof-step ordering** (drag scrambled steps into order) ⭐ | Practice | deterministic (sequence) |
| ④ | **Spot the flaw** (click the invalid line in a "proof") ⭐ | Practice | deterministic (line match) |
| ⑤ | **Proof fill-in-the-blank** (supply the missing justification) | Practice | deterministic if optioned; AI if free | 
| ⑥ | **Free-response + AI hint ladder** (real proof problem) ⭐ | Challenge | AI rubric judge |

③ ④ ⑤ are the bridge that makes *proof-heavy* content quizzable and auto-gradable. Warm-up flashcards can seed from the existing `focsSectionNotes` vocabulary/formulas.

## 6. Mastery model (chapter-level, upward-only in v1)

Mastery is **earned**, not toggled. It is a separate signal from the existing manual "learned" dot: the dot = *"I read it"*; mastery = *"I can do it."*

| Tier | Earned by |
|------|-----------|
| **Not started** | nothing practiced |
| **Familiar** | warm-up flashcards completed **and** practice attempted once (≥ 50% correct) |
| **Proficient** | every practice question answered correctly at least once (across all formats) |
| **Mastered** | ≥ 1 challenge problem judged correct by the AI **and reached through the student's own work** — if they used the answer-reveal rung, that problem does **not** count (a twin problem is offered instead) |

**Rules (learning-science backed):**
- **No penalty during practice** — practice mistakes never drop a tier; you only climb (Khan's anxiety-reducing model).
- **Revealing the answer ≠ mastery** — Mastered must be earned by genuine work; a reveal triggers a twin problem (retrieval practice).
- **No demotion in v1** — durable-mastery demotion needs cross-session spaced review → phase 2.
- **Tiers are cumulative; display the highest earned.** Each tier's criterion is evaluated independently, and the shown tier is the max reached by any path. So a student who uses **skip to challenge** and succeeds can earn **Mastered** directly without a separate practice pass — earning a higher tier implies the lower ones. `masteryEngine` returns `max(eligibleTiers)`.

**Tree integration:** the chapter node in the Learning Progress tree gains an earned-mastery ring (Familiar/Proficient/Mastered); the existing manual learned dots are untouched; the `X.Y Problems` node is the practice entry point.

## 7. Hint ladder (the differentiator)

**Iron rule:** *one rung up per request, and every escalation requires a new student action* (another attempt / answering the tutor's question / an explicit "still stuck"). This rule is simultaneously the pedagogy (productive struggle) and the v1 anti-farming mechanism.

| Rung | May reveal |
|------|-----------|
| **L0 Attempt gate** | nothing — must show an attempt / say where stuck before L2+ unlocks |
| **L1 Encourage / Socratic nudge** | no content; a refocusing question |
| **L2 Conceptual hint** | names the idea/strategy ("this is pigeonhole") |
| **L3 Point to the textbook** | cites the relevant section ("see 1.5 Proof") |
| **L4 First step** | sets up the first step; student finishes |
| **L5 Full walkthrough** | full steps, interrupted by a self-explanation check |
| **L6 Answer reveal** | hard-gated: explicit confirm + logged → twin problem; does **not** count toward Mastered |

**v1 orchestration (existing `/api/chat`, frontend-driven):**
- The frontend holds `currentRung` per challenge problem; "still stuck" advances it one rung.
- Each help request builds a rung-constrained prompt: *"You are at rung L2. You may name the concept. You may NOT show steps or the answer."* The AI reacts to the student's **actual** latest attempt (this adaptivity is the value — not pre-scripted hints).
- **Leak guard:** the canonical solution is **withheld from the prompt below L4** and included at **L4+** so the model coaches toward it without hallucinating. The same solution/rubric grades the free response.

**v1 honest caveat:** rung state and answer are **not** server-isolated in v1, so a determined user could in principle bypass. The gates (L0 attempt + one-rung-per-turn + reveal-confirm) are enough to stop ordinary shortcutting. True hardening (server-side rung lock + hidden key + a separate farming classifier) is **phase 2** (needs Jin's backend).

## 8. Architecture

All new code under `frontend/src/practice/`. Three layers; pure logic kept free of React and I/O so it is unit-testable and doubles as the phase-2 backend spec (same approach as the grade-tracker's `grades_math`).

### Host integration
- `LearningModel.tsx` — when `isProblemsSection(activeTitle)`, render `<PracticePanel chapter=… />` in the left pane instead of `<SectionNotePanel>`; keep a "view study note" fallback; right textbook pane unchanged.

### Presentation layer
- `practice/PracticePanel.tsx` — orchestrator: stage state, unlock gating, "skip to challenge", reads the practice set, reads/writes mastery.
- `practice/MasteryHeader.tsx` — mastery bar + tier.
- `practice/StageStepper.tsx` — 3-stage stepper with lock state.
- `practice/formats/` — one component per format, uniform interface `{ question, onResult }`:
  - `Flashcard.tsx`, `McqQuestion.tsx`, `ProofOrderQuestion.tsx`, `SpotFlawQuestion.tsx`, `FillBlankQuestion.tsx`, `ChallengeProblem.tsx`
- `practice/HintLadder.tsx` — owns rung state for a challenge; renders the rung-by-rung exchange + reveal gate + twin problem.

### Pure logic layer (no React / no I/O — unit-tested) ⭐
- `practice/masteryEngine.ts` — results → tier + stage unlock (deterministic).
- `practice/grading.ts` — deterministic grading for MCQ / proof-order / spot-flaw / fill-blank.
- `practice/hintLadder.ts` — rung rules, prompt construction, advancement, answer-visibility policy.

### I/O boundary (only two)
- `practice/challengeChat.ts` — thin wrapper over existing `/api/chat` (via `apiBase.ts`): send rung-constrained prompt; grade free-response against rubric.
- `utils/practiceProgress.ts` — localStorage read/write (mirrors `learningBarLocalStorage`).

### Data
- `data/focsPracticeSets.ts` — mock problem bank, keyed by chapter (mirrors `focsSectionNotes` keyed by section). Chapter 1 hand-authored across all 6 formats with answer keys / rubrics.
- Types: `Flashcard`, `McqQuestion`, `ProofOrderQuestion`, `SpotFlawQuestion`, `FillBlankQuestion`, `ChallengeProblem`, `PracticeSet` (in `practice/types.ts` or extending `utils/sectionNotes`).

### Styling
- `practice/Practice.css` — scoped under `.practice`, reusing the editorial ivory + teal tokens (consistent with Report Card / Chat). No purple.

### Data flow
1. `LearningModel` detects a Problems section → mounts `PracticePanel(chapter)`.
2. `PracticePanel` loads the mock `PracticeSet` + mastery from localStorage.
3. Each question component reports a result → `masteryEngine` (pure) recomputes tier + unlocks → persisted to localStorage.
4. Challenge: `ChallengeProblem` + `HintLadder`; `hintLadder.ts` builds the rung prompt → `challengeChat.ts` → `/api/chat`; the free response is graded against the rubric; success by own work → `masteryEngine` awards Mastered.

## 9. Persistence

localStorage in v1, keyed by `textbookId + chapter` (mirrors the learning-bar storage), holding per-chapter mastery tier + stage progress + which practice items have been answered correctly. Anonymous use works. Sign-in-keyed server sync is phase 2.

## 10. Testing

Stand up a thin **vitest** setup (frontend has none today). Pure logic carries correctness:
- `masteryEngine.test.ts` — tier computation + stage unlock across representative sequences; the "reveal does not count toward Mastered" rule.
- `grading.test.ts` — each format: MCQ exact; proof-order full + partial; spot-flaw correct line; fill-blank with case/whitespace normalization.
- `hintLadder.test.ts` — advancement rules (one-per-turn, effort gate) and the **answer-visibility policy** (solution absent from the prompt below L4, present at L4+) — the leak-guard test.

The challenge/hint-ladder LLM round-trip is verified manually in the running app (signed in). We can unit-test the *prompt we build*, not the AI's reply.

## 11. Risks & mitigations

- **AI hallucinates math in hints** → withhold the answer below L4, supply the canonical solution at L4+ so the model coaches rather than re-derives; manual verification on Chapter 1's authored problems.
- **Free-response grading is fuzzy** → rubric-conditioned judging with partial credit; mastery requires a *correct* judgment, and a low-confidence judge can ask the student to confirm.
- **v1 leak (no server isolation)** → accepted, documented; gates stop ordinary shortcutting; hardening is phase 2.
- **Touching `LearningModel.tsx` (large, recently tuned by Jin)** → integration is additive (one conditional render branch + two small affordances); do not refactor unrelated parts.

## 12. Phasing

- **v1** — this spec: Chapter 1, mock content, frontend + existing `/api/chat`, localStorage.
- **Phase 2** — real problem extraction; server-side rung lock + hidden key + farming classifier; auto question-gen + QC; SymPy/code grading; demotion + spaced review; signed-in server persistence; all chapters + uploaded textbooks.

## What already exists (reuse, not rebuild)

- **`/api/chat`** (LearningModel.tsx:309/546/755) — single-shot JSON; the hint ladder and grading ride it (no new endpoint in v1).
- **The note/textbook split** (`useVerticalSplitPct`, LearningModel.tsx:966/1137) — Practice reuses it with a separate `PRACTICE_SPLIT_STORAGE_KEY`.
- **`FOCS_SECTION_NOTES`** — warm-up flashcards seed from Chapter 4's existing vocabulary/formulas; "view study note" reuses `SectionNotePanel`.
- **`handleOutlineSectionPreview` / `detail.sectionTitle`** (LearningModel.tsx:240) — the synchronous trigger source for `activeSectionTitle`.
- **`apiBase.apiUrl`, `learningBarLocalStorage` pattern, `MathText` (KaTeX), the reference-page pane** — all reused.

## NOT in scope (deferred, with rationale)

- **Server-side integrity** (hidden key, rung lock, anti-farming classifier) — unenforceable client-side; the honest home is the backend → phase 2.
- **Shared `/api/chat` client across the 4 callers** (T16) — refactoring Jin's 3 sites is collaborative-repo scope creep → TODO.
- **Demotion / spaced review** — needs cross-session scheduling → phase 2.
- **Real problem extraction, auto question-gen, SymPy/code grading, signed-in sync, chapters beyond 4, uploaded textbooks** — content/backend weight → phase 2.
- **`spot-flaw` + `fill-blank`** — in v1 scope but sequenced as fast-follow (T13/T14) after the spine proves out.

## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT

| Review | Trigger | Why | Runs | Status | Findings |
|--------|---------|-----|------|--------|----------|
| CEO Review | `/plan-ceo-review` | Scope & strategy | 0 | — | not run (optional) |
| Eng Review | `/plan-eng-review` | Architecture & tests (required) | 1 | **CLEAR** | 5 review decisions (D1–D5) + scope challenge; 0 unresolved, 0 critical gaps |
| Outside Voice | Claude subagent | Independent challenge | 1 | issues_found | 11 findings, all folded (2 critical: wrong chapter, false "frontend-only") |
| Design Review | `/plan-design-review` | UI/UX gaps | 1 | **CLEAR (7→9/10)** | 4 decisions (feedback model, states table, drag/click a11y, mobile split); 0 unresolved |

- **CROSS-MODEL:** the outside voice contradicted four locked assumptions — Chapter 1 content (→ Chapter 4, D7), frontend-only (→ client-side `activeSectionTitle`), leak-guard integrity (→ prompt hygiene, D8), exact-order grading (→ topological-sort, D9). All four corrected and re-locked.
- **DESIGN:** focused review on states / a11y / responsive (visuals + IA already locked in brainstorm). Added: explain-on-wrong feedback, full states table, keyboard path for drag/click (the biggest gap), mobile full-width layout.
- **UNRESOLVED:** 0.
- **VERDICT:** ENG + DESIGN CLEARED — ready to implement. Build order: **T1 (AI-grading go/no-go eval) → T2 (vitest harness) → spine T3–T12 → fast-follow T13–T15.** Tasks + test plan in `~/.gstack/projects/JinBoatus1-AI_tutor/`.
- **Tooling note:** `gstack-review-log` is broken on this install (invalid-JSON / unbound-var; UPGRADE_AVAILABLE 1.40→1.57), so this entry is not in the `/ship` dashboard until gstack is upgraded.
